-- Exercise 1: â€‹Using any methods you like determine if you can you trust this events table.

SELECT date(event_time) AS date,
COUNT(*) AS rows
FROM dsv1069.events_201701
GROUP BY date;

-- NO NULL values were returned. 
-- This table is considered to be very limited in scope.
-- So in this case, don't use the table due to the limited time frame
-- unless the scope of the project is focused on January 2017.


--Exercise 2:
-- Using any methods you like, determine if you can you trust this events table. (HINT: When did we start recording events on mobile)

SELECT MIN(date(event_time)) as dater, MAX(platform)
FROM dsv1069.events_ex2
GROUP BY platform;

-- From analysis, capturing of Android and iOS data started in 2016, 
--compared to mobile web 2013 and server and web data starting capture in 2012.
